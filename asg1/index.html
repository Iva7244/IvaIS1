	<p>Future assignments will be listed here</p>
	<ol>
		<li>I learned about critical making, which is creating pieces 
			that bring attention to injustice and question societal norms. 
			This practice can also be applied to web design through internet 
			art and online activism.</li>
		<li>I also learned about the 3 main eras of the internet, the read-only web, 
			read-write web, and read-write-execute, and the possibilities of web 3.0 
			such as universal applications and a decentralized web. It was interesting 
			to think about how power may be taken away from large tech companies and 
			given to users. </li>
		<li>I learned about how I should begin by learning old standards such as HTML 
			because browsers continue to support them. I also understand that there is 
			a time and place for developer friendly tools. Itâ€™s important to always be 
			expanding my knowledge and ensuring everything I make is carefully thought out.</li>

<h2>Semester project</h2>
	<p>I'm interested in creating a site for the comet cupboard. Students who could benefit from
	using the comet cupboard are often put off by how confusing and inconsistent it is, so this
	site could be have the comet cupboard user orientation, an inventory of the items in stock for
	the week, and anouncements on when the cupboard is closed.</p>
