  <p>HTML can communicate visual hierarchy to readers while also 
    communicating semantic information to algorithms, but structured 
    content can be easily processed by algorithms and gives them the 
    ability to provide concise answers to questions.</p>
  <p>By combining structuring content meaningfully and having HTML markup 
    that clearly shows information hierarchy, the content relationships can 
    be communicated to the algorithm and the user.</p>
  <p> Itâ€™s important to have structured content because the data can be understood, 
    adapted, and remixed by algorithms to give users accurate search results, 
    while semantic HTML is important because visual hierarchy can be used to make 
    information easy for users to understand. </p>
