  <h1>Part 2 Questions</h1>
  <p>HTML can communicate visual hierarchy to readers while also 
    communicating semantic information to algorithms, but structured 
    content can be easily processed by algorithms and gives them the 
    ability to provide concise answers to questions.</p>
  <p>By combining structuring content meaningfully and having HTML markup 
    that clearly shows information hierarchy, the content relationships can 
    be communicated to the algorithm and the user.</p>
  <p> Itâ€™s important to have structured content because the data can be understood, 
    adapted, and remixed by algorithms to give users accurate search results, 
    while semantic HTML is important because visual hierarchy can be used to make 
    information easy for users to understand. </p>

	<p>I believe reassigning my inner critic's duty would be the most beneficial for me. 
	I could use the attention to details and judgement in the iteration phase to 
	determine what design is best.</p>
	<p>Hyperbolic discounting is our tendency to choose the immediate reward over 
	the later but larger reward. One of the methods McRaney proposes to combat this is
	to accept that the future you will still be impulsive, and you will have to make a commitment
	now to stop those future impulses like locking away or discarding distractions. I believe this
	method would work best for me because of how forceful it is and how it doesn't rely on the willpower
	my future self will have.</p>
	<p>I have the network-making power to make my creations accessible or inaccessible to disabled users.
	I should use my power to ensure that I follow ADA guidelines and collect and implement feedback from 
	those in the disabled community.</p>
