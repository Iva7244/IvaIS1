  <h2>The Iron Giant (1999)</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>In October 1957, during the Cold War, an object from space crashes 
    into the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters a forest 
    near the town of Rockwell. The following night, young Hogarth Hughes 
    investigates and finds the object – a fifty-foot tall robot of 
    extraterrestrial origin; he flees, but returns to save this thing from being 
    electrocuted when it attempts to take apart a substation for sustenance. 
    Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. 
    When the Giant eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, 
    it collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, 
    discovering that he can self-repair. Hogarth shows the Giant his comic book 
    collection and compares him to Superman.</p>
  <p>The Giant rescues a pair of boys falling from a roof when he's downtown, 
    winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant and, even though Dean 
    tells him about Hogarth, he deliberately goads Rogard into fighting back. 
    The Giant uses his flight system to evade the military at first, but is shot 
    down and crash-lands. Hogarth is rendered unconscious, but the Giant assumes 
    that Hogarth is dead. The soldiers open fire and enrage the Giant, who activates 
    his defense systems and attacks the army. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a 
    nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus, as conventional weapons prove 
    ineffective. Hogarth awakens and hastily calms down the Giant, while Dean 
    clarifies the situation to Rogard.</p>
  <p>Rogard is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to abort the missile’s 
    launch, but Mansley snatches Rogard's communicator and impulsively orders it. 
    A furious Rogard points out that the missile, now aiming for the Giant, will also 
    destroy the town. Mansley tries to flee, but the Giant thwarts him and Rogard has 
    Mansley arrested. To save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies 
    off to intercept the missile, which explodes in the outer atmosphere, saving everyone. 
    However, the Giant is presumably destroyed, devastating Hogarth; Rogard removes his 
    helmet as a display of respect before leaving.</p>
