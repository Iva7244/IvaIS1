  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>Rainbow (also known as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow or Blackmore's 
    Rainbow) were an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1975 by 
    guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. They originally featured four members of 
    the American rock band Elf, including their singer Ronnie James Dio</p>
  <p>They are my favorite because of how their early albums helped shaped 
  the metal genre and fantasy themed music. Blackmore's epic guitar riffs combined with
  Dio's powerful vocal performances and mystical lyrics created some of the 
  most beautiful metal albums of their era.</p>
