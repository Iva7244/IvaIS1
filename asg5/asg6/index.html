  <h1>6 Thinking Hats</h1>
  <h2>White Hat</h2>
  <p>My partner asked me what problems I'm basing my changes to the comet 
    cupboard website off of.</p>
  <h2>Red Hat</h2>
  <p>My partner said that the idea made them feel good and was excited thinking
    about how the changes could help the cupboard.</p>
  <h2>Black Hat</h2>
  <p>My partner questioned if I'm truly putting the user first when making these
    changes.</p>
  <h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
  <p>My partner said that improving the cupboard website could potentially bring 
    in more customers, donations, and volunteers.</p>
  <h2>Green Hat</h2>
  <p>My partner suggested interviewing regular users of the cupboard and asking
    the staff about common issues they face.</p>
  <h2>Blue Hat</h2>
  <p>My partner said I should gather more information from those experienced with
    the comet cupboard to narrow down my problem statement.</p>
  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>I plan to research more about people's experiences using the comet cupboard.</p>
